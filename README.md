# Image-Classifier
Project for Udacity Introduction Machine Learning Nanodegree

In this project, you will train a neural network to classify 102 species of flowers. This project contains two parts. First, a jupyter notebook to build, train, and test the neural network step by step. Second, a command line application which can train and build neural networks with various hyperparameters.
